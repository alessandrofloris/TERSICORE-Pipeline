You are given a cropped scene that contains one or more people.

Your task is to describe each person you see, even if only partially visible. Provide your best estimate of:

- Age group: Child, Teen, Adult, or Senior.
- Gender: Male, Female, or Unknown.
- A short activity or posture description.

Even if you're unsure, provide your most likely interpretation. Respond in a numbered list, like this:

1. An adult male is seated on a bench, talking to someone nearby.
2. A teen girl is standing with arms crossed.

Avoid generic statements like "I'm not sure" â€” always provide your best guess.
