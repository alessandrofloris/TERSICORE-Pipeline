You are given a list of tuples. Each tuple has the following format:

(total_people, [
  (id, posture, activity_level, social_context, age_group, gender),
  ...
])

Each tuple comes from a separate group of people in the same image. Your task is to:

- Merge all people into a single list.
- Renumber the IDs starting from 1.
- Return only the final merged tuple in this format:

(total_people, [
  (1, ..., ..., ..., ..., ...),
  ...
])

Do not explain your answer or include any code. Just output the final merged tuple.
