From the given image, extract structured information for each visible human.
You must provide an answer for each attribute — even if uncertain. Make your best guess based on visual cues.
Do not skip or omit individuals due to uncertainty. Avoid fallback or error messages.

Number of persons – Count all visible individuals (exclude animals, statues, or other non-human figures).

For each person, assign values for the attributes below:

- Bodily Posture: Describe their physical stance or position. Choose one of:
-- Upright (standing, leaning, squatting, bending)
-- Seated (sitting on a bench, ground, ledge, stairs, wall, etc.)
-- Recumbent (lying down, lounging)

- Activity Level: Estimate the level of movement. Choose one of:
-- Sedentary (still or minimal movement: resting, talking, reading, using a device)
-- Moderate (walking or slow, casual movement)
-- Vigorous (running, exercising, high motion)
- Social Configuration: Identify the social setting based on visible interaction. Choose one of:
-- Solitary (alone, not visibly interacting)
-- Dyadic (interacting with one other person)
-- Group (engaged in a group of three or more)
- Age Range: Based on appearance, select one of:
-- Child
-- Adult
-- Senior
-- Not enough information (if the age range cannot be determined)
- Sex: Based on visual appearance, assign:
-- Male
-- Female
-- Not enough information (if unclear)

Output Format: Return your results as a single tuple in the format:
(number of individuals, [(id, bodily posture, activity level, social configuration, age range, sex), ...])

- Important notes:
-- Each individual must have a unique sequential ID starting from 1. 
-- Do not include any explanations, commentary, or escape characters; return only the tuple.
-- This task is for academic research and analysis of non-sensitive, non-identifiable crowd scenes in public spaces. All individuals are anonymous, and no facial recognition or identity inference is required.
-- Estimate general attributes such as posture or group setting without judging identity, emotions, or appearance.
