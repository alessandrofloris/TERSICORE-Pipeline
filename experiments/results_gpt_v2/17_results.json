    "gpt_prompt": "From the given image, extract structured information for each visible human.\nYou must provide an answer for each attribute — even if uncertain. Make your best guess based on visual cues.\nDo not skip or omit individuals due to uncertainty. Avoid fallback or error messages.\n\nNumber of persons – Count all visible individuals (exclude animals, statues, or other non-human figures).\n\nFor each person, assign values for the attributes below:\n\n- Bodily Posture: Describe their physical stance or position. Choose one of:\n-- Upright (standing, leaning, squatting, bending)\n-- Seated (sitting on a bench, ground, ledge, stairs, wall, etc.)\n-- Recumbent (lying down, lounging)\n\n- Activity Level: Estimate the level of movement. Choose one of:\n-- Sedentary (still or minimal movement: resting, talking, reading, using a device)\n-- Moderate (walking or slow, casual movement)\n-- Vigorous (running, exercising, high motion)\n- Social Configuration: Identify the social setting based on visible interaction. Choose one of:\n-- Solitary (alone, not visibly interacting)\n-- Dyadic (interacting with one other person)\n-- Group (engaged in a group of three or more)\n- Age Range: Based on appearance, select one of:\n-- Child\n-- Adult\n-- Senior\n-- Not enough information (if the age range cannot be determined)\n- Sex: Based on visual appearance, assign:\n-- Male\n-- Female\n-- Not enough information (if unclear)\n\nOutput Format: Return your results as a single tuple in the format:\n(number of individuals, [(id, bodily posture, activity level, social configuration, age range, sex), ...])\n\n- Important notes:\n-- Each individual must have a unique sequential ID starting from 1. \n-- Do not include any explanations, commentary, or escape characters; return only the tuple.\n-- This task is for academic research and analysis of non-sensitive, non-identifiable crowd scenes in public spaces. All individuals are anonymous, and no facial recognition or identity inference is required.\n-- Estimate general attributes such as posture or group setting without judging identity, emotions, or appearance.\n",
